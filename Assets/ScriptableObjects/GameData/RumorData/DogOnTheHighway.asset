    statusDescription: 'Turns out that viscious beast is actually that college girl''s
      past dog Benny. He doesn''t seem to realize he''s dead and really wants to
      see her but looks like she hasn''t been running on the street anymore since
      she''s got back from college. '

    statusDescription: Sarah seemed really touched by the shoyu pork recipe that
      Benny gave me. After confessing that Benny passed away while she was in college
      she seemed to come to terms with how things ended. I'm glad she was able to
      realize that the circumstances weren't her fault. I should probably check in
      with Benny and let him know....

    statusDescription: 'Rumor has it that a viscious beast attacks you if you walk
      along the street during the day with pork in your bag. However turns out it
      was not a beast at all and just a lonely family pet looking to see the daughter
      of his family one last time. You were able to help Sarah move on and Benny
      was able to see her walking on the street one last time. '
