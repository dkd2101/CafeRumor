  - text: I take it that it's successful?
    characterObject: {fileID: 11400000, guid: cbe03b5b437a53c438efbea7bf9f2a6f, type: 2}
  - text: Yeah. At the very least really close. This reminds me of those cold winter
      mornings, walking the family dog before class and coming home to the breakfast
      my mom prepared for me.
    characterObject: {fileID: 11400000, guid: acc6ee4d5a263aa488584013b170f75b, type: 2}
  - text: Oh. Are you a big dog family?
    characterObject: {fileID: 11400000, guid: cbe03b5b437a53c438efbea7bf9f2a6f, type: 2}
  - text: Yeah... his name was BENNY. Big friendly guy filled with so much energy.
      Too much honestly. I miss having to run with him every morning before I went
      to school. Haha.
    characterObject: {fileID: 11400000, guid: acc6ee4d5a263aa488584013b170f75b, type: 2}
  - text: Wow. A morning run every day is a lot for me to think about.
    characterObject: {fileID: 11400000, guid: cbe03b5b437a53c438efbea7bf9f2a6f, type: 2}
  - text: Yep. Benny definitely prepped for the track team in college. There is no
      greater motivator to wake up early than a dog standing on top of you and barking
      louder than the alarm clock.
    characterObject: {fileID: 11400000, guid: acc6ee4d5a263aa488584013b170f75b, type: 2}
  - text: So you still keep up with all your running in college?
